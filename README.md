# Project Info
This research project aims to develop a comprehensive monitoring system. The system's primary goal is to effectively identify and track cigarettes, with all related records being stored in a dedicated server.

# View Record
The ViewRecord page plays a crucial role in retrieving and displaying the data stored on the server. Through this page, users can access a comprehensive table that presents the recorded monitoring data in an organized manner. The table includes relevant information such as timestamps, unique identifiers, and captured images associated with each recorded event. Furthermore, to enhance user control and flexibility, the ViewRecord page offers edit and delete functionality for each individual record. Users can modify specific details or remove records as needed. Additionally, a "delete all" button is provided, allowing users to efficiently manage and handle all recorded data in one action.

# Monitor
The Monitor page is specifically designed to activate and control the object detection model. Upon accessing this page, users initiate the model, enabling it to detect cigarette butts in real-time. As the model runs, it continuously analyzes the camera feed, capturing images when a cigarette butt is detected. These images are then sent and posted to the server for storage and further analysis. To keep monitors informed and aware, the Monitor page provides an alert message box, displaying notifications whenever the model successfully detects a cigarette. This immediate feedback allows monitors to stay vigilant and take appropriate actions promptly.
